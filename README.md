spotify-dbus-controll
=====================

Scripts for controlling spotify (on linux) using dbus.

Initially posted to ubuntu forums [http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1797848].

The first version was written in bash and is called spotify-remote.sh.
I rewrote it in perl later, that is the spotify-dbus.pl file.
